DeepFace is a lightweight [face recognition](https://sefiks.com/2018/08/06/deep-face-recognition-with-keras/) and facial attribute analysis ([age](https://sefiks.com/2019/02/13/apparent-age-and-gender-prediction-in-keras/), [gender](https://sefiks.com/2019/02/13/apparent-age-and-gender-prediction-in-keras/), [emotion](https://sefiks.com/2018/01/01/facial-expression-recognition-with-keras/) and [race](https://sefiks.com/2019/11/11/race-and-ethnicity-prediction-in-keras/)) framework for python. It is a hybrid face recognition framework wrapping **state-of-the-art** models: [`VGG-Face`](https://sefiks.com/2018/08/06/deep-face-recognition-with-keras/), [`FaceNet`](https://sefiks.com/2018/09/03/face-recognition-with-facenet-in-keras/), [`OpenFace`](https://sefiks.com/2019/07/21/face-recognition-with-openface-in-keras/), [`DeepFace`](https://sefiks.com/2020/02/17/face-recognition-with-facebook-deepface-in-keras/), [`DeepID`](https://sefiks.com/2020/06/16/face-recognition-with-deepid-in-keras/), [`ArcFace`](https://sefiks.com/2020/12/14/deep-face-recognition-with-arcface-in-keras-and-python/), [`Dlib`](https://sefiks.com/2020/07/11/face-recognition-with-dlib-in-python/), `SFace`, `GhostFaceNet`, `Buffalo_L`.

[A modern face recognition pipeline](https://sefiks.com/2020/05/01/a-gentle-introduction-to-face-recognition-in-deep-learning/) consists of 5 common stages: [detect](https://sefiks.com/2020/08/25/deep-face-detection-with-opencv-in-python/), [align](https://sefiks.com/2020/02/23/face-alignment-for-face-recognition-in-python-within-opencv/), [normalize](https://sefiks.com/2020/11/20/facial-landmarks-for-face-recognition-with-dlib/), [represent](https://sefiks.com/2018/08/06/deep-face-recognition-with-keras/) and [verify](https://sefiks.com/2020/05/22/fine-tuning-the-threshold-in-face-recognition/). While DeepFace handles all these common stages in the background, you don’t need to acquire in-depth knowledge about all the processes behind it. You can just call its verification, find or analysis function with a single line of code.

[`Experiments`](https://github.com/serengil/deepface/tree/master/benchmarks) show that **human beings have 97.53% accuracy** on facial recognition tasks whereas those models already reached and passed that accuracy level.

## Installation [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/deepface.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/deepface/)

The easiest way to install deepface is to download it from [`PyPI`](https://pypi.org/project/deepface/). It's going to install the library itself and its prerequisites as well.

```shell
$ pip install deepface
```

Alternatively, you can also install deepface from its source code. Source code may have new features not published in pip release yet.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/serengil/deepface.git
$ cd deepface
$ pip install -e .
```

Once you installed the library, then you will be able to import it and use its functionalities.

```python
from deepface import DeepFace
```

**Face Verification** - [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/KRCvkNCOphE)

This function determines whether two facial images belong to the same person or to different individuals. It accepts exact image file paths as input, but also supports NumPy arrays, base64-encoded images, and URLs. The function returns a dictionary, where the key of interest is `verified`: True indicates the images are of the same person, while False means they are of different people. In addition to this binary classification, the function also provides a [`confidence`](https://youtu.be/QQ4vO6UOsFo) score that reflects the likelihood that the two images represent the same person.

```python
result = DeepFace.verify(img1_path = "img1.jpg", img2_path = "img2.jpg")
```

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/verify-credit.jpg" width="99%"></p>

**Face recognition** - [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/Hrjp-EStM_s)

[Face recognition](https://sefiks.com/2020/05/25/large-scale-face-recognition-for-deep-learning/) requires applying face verification many times. Herein, deepface has an out-of-the-box find function to handle this action. It's going to look for the identity of input image in the database path and it will return list of pandas data frame as output. Meanwhile, facial embeddings of the facial database are stored in a pickle file to be searched faster in next time. Result is going to be the size of faces appearing in the source image. Besides, target images in the database can have many faces as well.

```python
dfs = DeepFace.find(img_path = "img1.jpg", db_path = "C:/my_db")
```

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/stock-6-v2.jpg" width="95%"></p>

**Facial Attribute Analysis** - [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/GT2UeN85BdA)

> For Real Time Emotion Detection from Web-Cam you can directly run `rlt-inference.py` file. It will open your webcam and start to analyze your emotions.

```shell
$ python rlt-inference.py
```

DeepFace also comes with a strong facial attribute analysis module including [`age`](https://sefiks.com/2019/02/13/apparent-age-and-gender-prediction-in-keras/), [`gender`](https://sefiks.com/2019/02/13/apparent-age-and-gender-prediction-in-keras/), [`facial expression`](https://sefiks.com/2018/01/01/facial-expression-recognition-with-keras/) (including angry, fear, neutral, sad, disgust, happy and surprise) and [`race`](https://sefiks.com/2019/11/11/race-and-ethnicity-prediction-in-keras/) (including asian, white, middle eastern, indian, latino and black) predictions. Result is going to be the size of faces appearing in the source image.

```python
objs = DeepFace.analyze(
  img_path = "img4.jpg", actions = ['age', 'gender', 'race', 'emotion']
)
```

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/stock-2.jpg" width="95%"></p>

Age model got ± 4.65 MAE; gender model got 97.44% accuracy, 96.29% precision and 95.05% recall as mentioned in its [tutorial](https://sefiks.com/2019/02/13/apparent-age-and-gender-prediction-in-keras/).

**Real Time Analysis** - [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/-c9sSJcx6wI), [`React Demo part-i`](https://youtu.be/IXoah6rhxac), [`React Demo part-ii`](https://youtu.be/_waBA-cH2D4)

You can run deepface for real time videos as well. Stream function will access your webcam and apply both face recognition and facial attribute analysis. The function starts to analyze a frame if it can focus a face sequentially 5 frames. Then, it shows results 5 seconds.

```python
DeepFace.stream(db_path = "C:/database")
```

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/stock-3.jpg" width="90%"></p>

Even though face recognition is based on one-shot learning, you can use multiple face pictures of a person as well. You should rearrange your directory structure as illustrated below.

```bash
user
├── database
│   ├── Alice
│   │   ├── Alice1.jpg
│   │   ├── Alice2.jpg
│   ├── Bob
│   │   ├── Bob.jpg
```

If you intend to perform face verification or analysis tasks directly from your browser, [`deepface-react-ui`](https://github.com/serengil/deepface-react-ui) is a separate repository built using ReactJS depending on deepface api.

Here, you can also find some real time demos for various facial recognition models:

<p align="center"><img src="https://sefiks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/deepface-cover.jpg" width="90%"></p>

**Embeddings** - [`Tutorial`](https://sefiks.com/2025/06/28/what-are-vector-embeddings-and-why-they-matter-in-ai/), [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/OYialFo7Qo4)

Face recognition models basically represent facial images as multi-dimensional vectors. Sometimes, you need those embedding vectors directly. DeepFace comes with a dedicated representation function. Represent function returns a list of embeddings. Result is going to be the size of faces appearing in the image path.

```python
embedding_objs = DeepFace.represent(img_path = "img.jpg")
```

Embeddings can be [plotted](https://sefiks.com/2020/05/01/a-gentle-introduction-to-face-recognition-in-deep-learning/) as below. Each slot is corresponding to a dimension value and dimension value is emphasized with colors. Similar to 2D barcodes, vertical dimension stores no information in the illustration.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/embedding.jpg" width="95%"></p>

In summary, the distance between vector embeddings of the same person should be smaller than that between embeddings of different people. When reduced to two-dimensional space, the clusters become clearly distinguishable.

**Face recognition models** - [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/eKOZawGR3y0)

DeepFace is a **hybrid** face recognition package. It currently wraps many **state-of-the-art** face recognition models: [`VGG-Face`](https://sefiks.com/2018/08/06/deep-face-recognition-with-keras/) , [`FaceNet`](https://sefiks.com/2018/09/03/face-recognition-with-facenet-in-keras/), [`OpenFace`](https://sefiks.com/2019/07/21/face-recognition-with-openface-in-keras/), [`DeepFace`](https://sefiks.com/2020/02/17/face-recognition-with-facebook-deepface-in-keras/), [`DeepID`](https://sefiks.com/2020/06/16/face-recognition-with-deepid-in-keras/), [`ArcFace`](https://sefiks.com/2020/12/14/deep-face-recognition-with-arcface-in-keras-and-python/), [`Dlib`](https://sefiks.com/2020/07/11/face-recognition-with-dlib-in-python/), `SFace`, `GhostFaceNet` and `Buffalo_L`. The default configuration uses VGG-Face model.

```python
models = [
    "VGG-Face", "Facenet", "Facenet512", "OpenFace", "DeepFace",
    "DeepID", "ArcFace", "Dlib", "SFace", "GhostFaceNet",
    "Buffalo_L",
]

result = DeepFace.verify(
  img1_path = "img1.jpg", img2_path = "img2.jpg", model_name = models[0]
)

dfs = DeepFace.find(
  img_path = "img1.jpg", db_path = "C:/my_db", model_name = models[1]
)

embeddings = DeepFace.represent(
  img_path = "img.jpg", model_name = models[2]
)
```

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/model-portfolio-20240316.jpg" width="95%"></p>

FaceNet, VGG-Face, ArcFace and Dlib are overperforming ones based on experiments - see [`BENCHMARKS`](https://github.com/serengil/deepface/tree/master/benchmarks) for more details. You can find the measured scores of various models in DeepFace and the reported scores from their original studies in the following table.

| Model        | Measured Score | Declared Score |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------- |
| Facenet512   | 98.4%          | 99.6%          |
| Human-beings | 97.5%          | 97.5%          |
| Facenet      | 97.4%          | 99.2%          |
| Dlib         | 96.8%          | 99.3 %         |
| VGG-Face     | 96.7%          | 98.9%          |
| ArcFace      | 96.7%          | 99.5%          |
| GhostFaceNet | 93.3%          | 99.7%          |
| SFace        | 93.0%          | 99.5%          |
| OpenFace     | 78.7%          | 92.9%          |
| DeepFace     | 69.0%          | 97.3%          |
| DeepID       | 66.5%          | 97.4%          |

Conducting experiments with those models within DeepFace may reveal disparities compared to the original studies, owing to the adoption of distinct detection or normalization techniques. Furthermore, some models have been released solely with their backbones, lacking pre-trained weights. Thus, we are utilizing their re-implementations instead of the original pre-trained weights.

**Face Detection and Alignment** - [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/GZ2p2hj2H5k)

Face detection and alignment are important early stages of a modern face recognition pipeline. [Experiments](https://github.com/serengil/deepface/tree/master/benchmarks) show that detection increases the face recognition accuracy up to 42%, while alignment increases it up to 6%. [`OpenCV`](https://sefiks.com/2020/02/23/face-alignment-for-face-recognition-in-python-within-opencv/), [`Ssd`](https://sefiks.com/2020/08/25/deep-face-detection-with-opencv-in-python/), [`Dlib`](https://sefiks.com/2020/07/11/face-recognition-with-dlib-in-python/), [`MtCnn`](https://sefiks.com/2020/09/09/deep-face-detection-with-mtcnn-in-python/), `Faster MtCnn`, [`RetinaFace`](https://sefiks.com/2021/04/27/deep-face-detection-with-retinaface-in-python/), [`MediaPipe`](https://sefiks.com/2022/01/14/deep-face-detection-with-mediapipe/), `Yolo`, `YuNet` and `CenterFace` detectors are wrapped in deepface.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/detector-portfolio-v6.jpg" width="95%"></p>

All deepface functions accept optional detector backend and align input arguments. You can switch among those detectors and alignment modes with these arguments. OpenCV is the default detector and alignment is on by default.

```python
backends = [
    'opencv', 'ssd', 'dlib', 'mtcnn', 'fastmtcnn',
    'retinaface', 'mediapipe', 'yolov8n', 'yolov8m',
    'yolov8l', 'yolov11n', 'yolov11s', 'yolov11m',
    'yolov11l', 'yolov12n', 'yolov12s', 'yolov12m',
    'yolov12l', 'yunet', 'centerface',
]
detector = backends[3]
align = True

obj = DeepFace.verify(
  img1_path = "img1.jpg", img2_path = "img2.jpg", detector_backend = detector, align = align
)

dfs = DeepFace.find(
  img_path = "img.jpg", db_path = "my_db", detector_backend = detector, align = align
)

embedding_objs = DeepFace.represent(
  img_path = "img.jpg", detector_backend = detector, align = align
)

demographies = DeepFace.analyze(
  img_path = "img4.jpg", detector_backend = detector, align = align
)

face_objs = DeepFace.extract_faces(
  img_path = "img.jpg", detector_backend = detector, align = align
)
```

Face recognition models are actually CNN models and they expect standard sized inputs. So, resizing is required before representation. To avoid deformation, deepface adds black padding pixels according to the target size argument after detection and alignment.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/detector-outputs-20240414.jpg" width="90%"></p>

[RetinaFace](https://sefiks.com/2021/04/27/deep-face-detection-with-retinaface-in-python/) and [MtCnn](https://sefiks.com/2020/09/09/deep-face-detection-with-mtcnn-in-python/) seem to overperform in detection and alignment stages but they are much slower. If the speed of your pipeline is more important, then you should use opencv or ssd. On the other hand, if you consider the accuracy, then you should use retinaface or mtcnn.

The performance of RetinaFace is very satisfactory even in the crowd as seen in the following illustration. Besides, it comes with an incredible facial landmark detection performance. Highlighted red points show some facial landmarks such as eyes, nose and mouth. That's why, alignment score of RetinaFace is high as well.

You can find out more about RetinaFace on this [repo](https://github.com/serengil/retinaface).

**Face Anti Spoofing** - [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/UiK1aIjOBlQ)

DeepFace also includes an anti-spoofing analysis module to understand given image is real or fake. To activate this feature, set the `anti_spoofing` argument to True in any DeepFace tasks.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/face-anti-spoofing.jpg" width="40%"></p>

```python
# anti spoofing test in face detection
face_objs = DeepFace.extract_faces(img_path="dataset/img1.jpg", anti_spoofing = True)
assert all(face_obj["is_real"] is True for face_obj in face_objs)

# anti spoofing test in real time analysis
DeepFace.stream(db_path = "C:/database", anti_spoofing = True)
```

**Similarity** - [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/1EPoS69fHOc)

Face recognition models are regular [convolutional neural networks](https://sefiks.com/2018/03/23/convolutional-autoencoder-clustering-images-with-neural-networks/) and they are responsible to represent faces as vectors. We expect that a face pair of same person should be [more similar](https://sefiks.com/2020/05/22/fine-tuning-the-threshold-in-face-recognition/) than a face pair of different persons.

Similarity could be calculated by different metrics such as [Cosine Similarity](https://sefiks.com/2018/08/13/cosine-similarity-in-machine-learning/), Angular Distance, Euclidean Distance or L2 normalized Euclidean. The default configuration uses cosine similarity. According to [experiments](https://github.com/serengil/deepface/tree/master/benchmarks), no distance metric is overperforming than other.

```python
metrics = ["cosine", "euclidean", "euclidean_l2", "angular"]

result = DeepFace.verify(
  img1_path = "img1.jpg", img2_path = "img2.jpg", distance_metric = metrics[1]
)

dfs = DeepFace.find(
  img_path = "img1.jpg", db_path = "C:/my_db", distance_metric = metrics[2]
)
```

**API** - [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/HeKCQ6U9XmI), [`Docker Demo`](https://youtu.be/9Tk9lRQareA)

DeepFace serves an API as well - see [`api folder`](https://github.com/serengil/deepface/tree/master/deepface/api/src) for more details. You can clone deepface source code and run the api with the following command. It will use gunicorn server to get a rest service up. In this way, you can call deepface from an external system such as mobile app or web.

```shell
cd scripts

# run the service directly
./service.sh

# run the service via docker
./dockerize.sh
```

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/deepface-api.jpg" width="90%"></p>

Face recognition, facial attribute analysis and vector representation functions are covered in the API. You are expected to call these functions as http post methods. Default service endpoints will be `http://localhost:5005/verify` for face recognition, `http://localhost:5005/analyze` for facial attribute analysis, and `http://localhost:5005/represent` for vector representation. The API accepts images as file uploads (via form data), or as exact image paths, URLs, or base64-encoded strings (via either JSON or form data), providing versatile options for different client requirements. [Here](https://github.com/serengil/deepface/tree/master/deepface/api/postman), you can find a postman project to find out how these methods should be called.

**Large Scale Facial Recognition** - [`Playlist`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsS_1RYmYQQGSJu_Z3OVhXhGmZ86_zuIm)

If your task requires facial recognition on large datasets, you should combine DeepFace with a vector index or vector database. This setup will perform [approximate nearest neighbor](https://youtu.be/c10w0Ptn_CU) searches instead of exact ones, allowing you to identify a face in a database containing billions of entries within milliseconds. Common vector index solutions include [Annoy](https://youtu.be/Jpxm914o2xk), [Faiss](https://youtu.be/6AmEvDTKT-k), [Voyager](https://youtu.be/2ZYTV9HlFdU), [NMSLIB](https://youtu.be/EVBhO8rbKbg), [ElasticSearch](https://youtu.be/i4GvuOmzKzo). For vector databases, popular options are [Postgres with its pgvector extension](https://youtu.be/Xfv4hCWvkp0) and [RediSearch](https://youtu.be/yrXlS0d6t4w).

Conversely, if your task involves facial recognition on small to moderate-sized databases, you can adopt use relational databases such as [Postgres](https://youtu.be/f41sLxn1c0k) or [SQLite](https://youtu.be/_1ShBeWToPg), or NoSQL databases like [Mongo](https://youtu.be/dmprgum9Xu8), [Redis](https://youtu.be/X7DSpUMVTsw) or [Cassandra](https://youtu.be/J_yXpc3Y8Ec) to perform exact nearest neighbor search.

**Encrypt Embeddings** - [`Demo with PHE`](https://youtu.be/8VCu39jFZ7k), [`Tutorial for PHE`](https://sefiks.com/2025/03/04/vector-similarity-search-with-partially-homomorphic-encryption-in-python/), [`Demo with FHE`](https://youtu.be/njjw0PEhH00), [`Tutorial for FHE`](https://sefiks.com/2021/12/01/homomorphic-facial-recognition-with-tenseal/)

Vector embeddings, though not reversible, carry sensitive information like fingerprints, making their security crucial. Encrypting them prevents adversarial misuse. Traditional encryption (e.g., AES) is secure but unsuitable for cloud-based distance calculations.

[Homomorphic encryption](https://youtu.be/3ejI0zNPMEQ) allows computations on encrypted data without revealing content—ideal for secure cloud processing. For example, the cloud can compute encrypted similarity without knowing the data, while only the key holder can decrypt the result. See the [`LightPHE`](https://github.com/serengil/LightPHE) library for partially homomorphic encryption.

```python
from lightphe import LightPHE

# build an additively homomorphic cryptosystem (e.g. Paillier) on-prem
cs = LightPHE(algorithm_name = "Paillier", precision = 19)

# define plain vectors for source and target
alpha = DeepFace.represent("img1.jpg")[0]["embedding"]
beta = DeepFace.represent("target.jpg")[0]["embedding"]

# encrypt source embedding on-prem - private key not required
encrypted_alpha = cs.encrypt(alpha)

# dot product of encrypted & plain embedding in cloud - private key not required
encrypted_cosine_similarity = encrypted_alpha @ beta

# decrypt similarity on-prem - private key required
calculated_similarity = cs.decrypt(encrypted_cosine_similarity)[0]

# verification
print("same person" if calculated_similarity >= 1 - threshold else "different persons")
```

For stronger privacy, fully homomorphic encryption enables dot product computations between encrypted embeddings, but it's far more computationally intensive. Explore [`CipherFace`](https://github.com/serengil/cipherface) for FHE-based approaches.

### Extended Applications

DeepFace can also be used for fun and insightful applications such as
