  "description": "The Image & Preprocessing Utilities component serves as the foundational layer for all image-related operations within the system. It encompasses a crucial set of helper functions and modules dedicated to handling image data from its raw input state through various transformations, ensuring it is optimally prepared for subsequent deep learning model consumption. This includes functionalities for loading images from diverse sources, resizing them to required dimensions, and applying normalization techniques.",
