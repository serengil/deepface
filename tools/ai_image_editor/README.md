## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ (Python 3.11.3 recommended)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, for faster processing)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/ai-image-editor.git
cd ai-image-editor
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the application**:
```bash
python editor.py
```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

## 📋 Dependencies

```
gradio>=4.0.0
opencv-python>=4.8.0
deepface>=0.0.79
tensorflow==2.10.0
numpy>=1.24.0
Pillow>=10.0.0
openai>=1.0.0

## 🎯 Model Performance

Our face verification system has been optimized through comprehensive testing:

- **Model**: VGG-Face with cosine distance metric
- **Threshold**: 0.8 (optimized for best accuracy)
- **Accuracy**: 100% on test datasets
- **Speed**: ~2-3 seconds per verification on CPU

### Model Testing Results
We tested 7 different DeepFace models with 3 distance metrics across 9 threshold values:
- **Best Model**: VGG-Face
- **Best Distance Metric**: Cosine
- **Optimal Threshold**: 0.8
- **Same Person Distance**: ~0.73 (below threshold)
- **Different Person Distance**: ~0.91 (above threshold)

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Face Verification
```python
from detection import face_verify

# Verify two images
result, status = face_verify(image1, image2)
print(f"Verification: {status}")
```

### Face Analysis
```python
from detection import face_features

# Analyze facial features
features = face_features(image)
print(f"Age: {features['age']}")
print(f"Gender: {features['gender']}")
print(f"Emotion: {features['emotion']}")
```

### Object Removal
```python
from detection import object_remover

# Remove objects from image
processed_image, detected_objects = object_remover(image, "face")
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Models

Use the included model testing script to find optimal settings for your specific use case:

```bash
python model_tester.py
```

This will:
1. Test all available DeepFace models

## 📝 API Documentation

### Core Functions

#### `face_verify(img1, img2, model_name="VGG-Face", threshold=0.8)`
Verifies if two images show the same person.

**Parameters:**
- `img1`, `img2`: PIL Image objects
- `model_name`: DeepFace model to use
- `threshold`: Verification threshold

**Returns:**
- Tuple of (combined_image, status_message)

#### `face_features(img)`
Analyzes facial features in an image.

**Returns:**
- Dictionary with age, gender, emotion, and race predictions

#### `object_remover(img, object_type="face")`
Removes specified objects from an image.

**Returns:**
- Tuple of (processed_image, detected_objects_list)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All image processing happens locally on your machine
- **No Data Storage**: Images are not stored or transmitted to external servers
- **Optional API**: Chatbot feature requires OpenAI API key (can be disabled)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Module not found" errors:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

**GPU not detected:**
- Ensure CUDA and cuDNN are properly installed
- Check TensorFlow GPU compatibility
- Fallback to CPU processing is automatic

**Port already in use:**
- The application will automatically find an available port
- Check for other Python processes: `taskkill /f /im python.exe` (Windows)
