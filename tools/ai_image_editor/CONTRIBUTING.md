# Contributing to AI Image Editor

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AI Image Editor project! We welcome contributions from the community and are excited to work with you.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/ai-image-editor.git
   cd ai-image-editor
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Make your changes** and test thoroughly
6. **Submit a pull request**

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow **PEP 8** Python style guidelines
- Use **meaningful variable and function names**
- Add **docstrings** for all functions and classes
- Include **type hints** where appropriate
- Keep **line length under 100 characters**

### Code Structure
```python
def function_name(param1: str, param2: int) -> tuple:
    """
    Brief description of what the function does.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of parameter 1
        param2: Description of parameter 2
    
    Returns:
        Tuple containing (result, status_message)
    """
    # Implementation here
    return result, status
```

### Testing
- Test your changes with different image types and sizes
- Verify compatibility with all supported DeepFace models
- Test both CPU and GPU execution paths (if applicable)
- Include edge case testing (empty images, invalid formats, etc.)

## üéØ Areas for Contribution

### High Priority
- **Performance Optimization**: Improve processing speed
- **Model Integration**: Add support for new DeepFace models
- **Error Handling**: Enhance robustness and error recovery
- **Mobile Support**: Improve mobile web interface experience

### Medium Priority
- **Additional Image Formats**: Support for more file types
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple images simultaneously
- **API Endpoints**: REST API for programmatic access
- **Configuration**: User-configurable settings and preferences

### Nice to Have
- **Dark Mode**: Alternative UI theme
- **Image History**: Keep track of processed images
- **Export Options**: Different output formats and quality settings
- **Plugins**: Extensible architecture for custom features

## üêõ Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

### Required Information
- **Python version** (e.g., 3.11.3)
- **Operating system** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Browser** (for web interface issues)

### Bug Description
- **Clear title** describing the issue
- **Steps to reproduce** the bug
- **Expected behavior** vs **actual behavior**
- **Error messages** or logs (if any)
- **Screenshots** (if relevant)

### Example Bug Report
```markdown
## Bug: Face verification fails with large images

**Environment:**
- Python 3.11.3
- Windows 11
- Chrome 120.0

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Upload two images larger than 5MB
2. Click "Verify Faces"
3. Error occurs during processing

**Expected:** Should resize and process images
**Actual:** Memory error with large images

**Error message:**
```
MemoryError: Unable to allocate array...
```
```
